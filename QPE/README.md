# Finding the number of QPE calls per DetectMV

In Appendix F we derive values of epsilon and alpha used to derive how many times QPE needs to be called per DetectMV run.
To find such values we used the script `qpe.py` in this directory.

## Run

The only dependency is Numpy. To run, call
```
$ python qpe.py
```

## Output

An example of a run of the script can be found in `output.txt`.
